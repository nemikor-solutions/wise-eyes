# Wise Eyes

![logo](./assets/wise-eyes.svg)

A web server to monitor the status of owlcms. Originally designed for use with [vMix](https://www.vmix.com/) for custom livestream content during weightlifting meets, but flexible enough to drive any system that wants to poll the current state.

_Requires owlcms v48 or newer_
